### üëã

Hi, there, welcome to my github page!

I am a **Mathematician,** working at the [Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Brazil](https://ufrj.br/en/), with a PhD degree in Applied Mathematics from the [Indiana University](https://www.indiana.edu), from 1996. I have a diverse range of interest in Mathematics, both pure and applied, with most of the topics involving some sort of differential equation, with past and present projects in the Oil & Field industry and with financial organizations. I have [a number of publications totaling 1000+ citations](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/MRAuthorID/366407), including the book [Navier-Stokes Equations and Turbulence](https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511546754), co-authored with Ciprian Foias, Oscar P. Manley, and Roger Temam.

In **education,** I like making most of my textbooks freely available, although mostly in Portuguese. Here are some: [Random notes (Bayesian probabilistic programing)](https://rmsrosa.github.io/random_notes/dev/), [Equa√ß√µes diferenciais (pdf)](https://rmsrosa.github.io/assets/material/apostila-ed-ago2022.pdf), [Modelagem Matem√°tica](https://github.com/rmsrosa/modelagem_matematica), [Aspectos te√≥ricos e num√©ricos de equa√ß√µes diferenciais estoc√°sticas (SDE) e aleat√≥rias (RODE)](https://rmsrosa.github.io/notas_sde/), [Tutorial Flux](https://github.com/rmsrosa/TutorialFlux).

Lately I have been enjoying doing **numerics and coding** in the [Julia language](https://julialang.org). I've been helping the Julia community [with discussions, issues and PRs](https://github.com/notifications?query=reason%3Aparticipating); as a moderator of the [Humans of Julia Discord community](https://disboard.org/server/762167454973296644); contributing to the [SciML: Open Source Software for Scientific Machine Learning](https://sciml.ai) organization as part of the [DiffEq team](https://github.com/orgs/SciML/teams/diffeq/members); and contributing to the [JuliaDynamics](https://github.com/JuliaDynamics) organization, developing the package [LagrangianDescriptors.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDynamics/LagrangianDescriptors.jl).

Other relevant packages I am developing myself are [ChainPlots.jl](https://github.com/rmsrosa/ChainPlots.jl), [UnitfulBuckinhamPi.jl](https://github.com/rmsrosa/UnitfulBuckinghamPi.jl), and [UnitfulAssets.jl](https://github.com/rmsrosa/UnitfulAssets.jl).

Among other hobbies, I am also a **homebrewer,** brewing beer since 2000, and one of the founders of the [ACervA Carioca](http://www.acervacarioca.com.br/), which played a major role on the growth of the homebrewing community in Brazil. Although mostly a homebrewer, I have made a few **commercial beers,** partening with microbreweries and restaurants, such as the award winning [Colorado Demoiselle](https://www.cervejariacolorado.com.br/produto/demoiselle) (gold medal at the [European Beer Star Awards 2008](https://www.european-beer-star.com)), [Colorado Berth√¥](https://www.ambev.com.br/marcas/cervejas/colorado/colorado-bertho), with Brazil nuts (Castanha do Par√°), [DadoBier Double Chocolate Stout (DCS)](https://www.brejas.com.br/cerveja/brasil/dado-bier-double-chocolate-stout); [Apraz√≠vel Pale Ale](https://www.cervejaaprazivel.com.br); and [Mistura Cl√°ssica Vertigem IPA](https://www.misturaclassica.com.br/cerveja/vertigem) (gold medal at the Mondial de La Bi√®re 2014), among others.
